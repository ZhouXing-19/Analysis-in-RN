If $A,B$ are compact $\rightarrow$ $A+B :=\{a_i + b_i , \forall a_i \in A, \forall b_i \in B\}$ is compact 

Proof:
- $A$ is compact  $\implies \{a_i\}$ is a subset of $A$ with a limit point in A (By theorem 2.37)
- $\{a_{i_j}\}$ is a subseq of  $\{a_i\}$, which satisfies $\{a_{i_j}\} \rightarrow a \in A$  (by theorem 3.2 (d))
- We don't know if $\{b_{i_j}\}$ is convergent yet! But we do know that it's a subset of compact set $B$ $\implies \{b_{i_{j_k}}\}$ as a subseq of $\{b_{i_j}\},  \{b_{i_{j_k}}\}\rightarrow b \in B$
-  Any subseq of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit $\implies \{a_{i_{j_k}}\} \rightarrow a$
- Thus  $\{a_{i_{j_k}} + b_{i_{j_k}}\} \rightarrow a+b \in A+B$

If $A$ is compact  and $B$ is closed $\rightarrow$ $A+B :=\{a_i + b_i , \forall a_i \in A, \forall b_i \in B\}$ is closed
